&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Presuming you've found yourself here, you have likely stumbled across my resume, was referred to by myself in person, or randomly searched for my name for whatever reason.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">I welcome you!</h1>

To be honest, this project page here is what I was provided by default with the web framework that I was given. However, I felt it such a shame to let such good code go to waste. So I decided to indulge in some explanation.

### 24 hours ago...

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I was wanting to create a website so that, when I created a portfolio that was abbreviated for a job application, I could link to a full portfolio in the bottom text both explaining myself and providing my full credentials. In doing so, I discovered the following:

1. I don't want to host a website for my portfolio
2. I do still want a website
3. Cloudflare has this new pages thing...
4. I can use a new framework to host this serverless!

Hence I decided to do this. Though this is mainly meant as a portfolio, I will be including more projects here. For instance, I recently made an ePaper display which uses a Raspberry Pi 0w to pull from and update the display with whatever tasks I have to do that day based on what is provided in my any.do task list. I even helped update the framework that the project uses to pull from any.do with tag support!
